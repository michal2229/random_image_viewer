# random_image_viewer

This project is an image viewer made in Godot game engine, which allows to browse images one after the other or randomly.
The random browse is useful when one wants to quickly scan the image dir with lots of images. 
There are also options to pick and save chosen images and to delete them.
UI is quite unconventional - it shows images previous in directory as well as next ones in different scale, depending on distance on the sorted file path list from the currently viewed one.
Navigation is done mainly using keyboard actions, but there's also basic mouse navigation implemented. 

Video of the viewer in action (please note how file indices on the bottom left of the images change - different navigation modes):
